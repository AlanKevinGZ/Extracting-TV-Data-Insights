#  Super Bowl Data Analysis

This project explores historical Super Bowl data using Python and pandas to extract insights about television audiences, game competitiveness, and halftime show performances.

The objective is to demonstrate practical data analysis skills such as cleaning data, identifying trends, filtering records, aggregating information, and producing clear conclusions from real-world datasets.

---

## Project Goals

The analysis focuses on answering three main questions:

1. Has TV viewership increased over time?
2. How many games ended with a point difference greater than 40?
3. Which halftime performer sang the most songs?

Each question required a different analytical approach, combining data cleaning, filtering, aggregation, and interpretation.

## Datasets

### Super Bowls
Contains historical game information including:
- Teams
- Final scores
- Point differences
- Venues and locations
- Attendance

### TV
Contains broadcast metrics such as:
- Average and total viewers
- Household ratings and shares
- Advertising costs

### Halftime Musicians
Contains halftime show data including:
- Performer names
- Number of songs performed per show

## Methodology

### Viewership Trend Analysis
Missing values were removed and the data was sorted chronologically. Total viewers were compared across time to determine whether there is an overall upward or downward trend. A visualization was used to confirm the pattern.

### Game Competitiveness
Point differences were analyzed to identify highly unbalanced matches. Games with score differences greater than 40 points were filtered and counted.

### Halftime Performances
Performers were evaluated based on the number of songs played. The maximum value was identified to determine which artist performed the most songs overall.

## About This Project

This project was completed as a hands-on exercise to strengthen practical data analysis and pandas skills. The focus is on clean logic, reproducible analysis, and clear interpretation rather than complex or unnecessary code.
